Thank you for choosing Ark Technologies, the developer and provider of Ark Trading—the first online trading platform choice for traders. Welcome to the Ark Trader family.

This article provides guidance on using the Ark Trader Client's Login screen.

## Login Options

From the Login Form, you can:

- Log in or create either Demo or Real accounts (if your broker enables online account creation).
- Use either:
  - **Trading Login**: Control over one account only.
  - **Office Login**: Control over one or multiple accounts, with the ability to navigate trading between accounts.

## Login Form Fields

1. **Broker Name**: Search for your broker’s name by typing the first 3 characters. If it is not listed, please contact us.
2. **Username**: Enter your Client's Username or Office Username provided to your valid email or by your broker.
3. **Password**: Enter the Password provided by your broker. If you don't have it, follow step 4 to reset.
4. **Forgot Password**: Reset your password using your registered email:
   - Click on "Forgot Password" and enter your valid email.
   - Once the system confirms the email is registered under your broker, it will prompt you to:
     - Enter your valid username.
     - Enter the Token received via email (a string with more than 16 characters).
     - Set your new password.
5. **Save Credentials**: Enable this option to avoid entering your username and password on the next login.
6. **Login and Take-Off**: Click to log in to your account.

## Creating Accounts

7. **Demo Account**: Open a demo account by filling in your information. Ensure you provide a valid email to reset your password if needed.
   - After creating your demo account, verify it by copying the token received via email and pasting it into the "Acc Token" text box.
8. **Live Account**: If your broker enables online live account creation, you can create a live account and deposit funds online.

## Additional Options

9. **Cancel**: Click to close the login screen.
10. **Social Media**: Visit your broker's social media pages by clicking on the respective icons.
